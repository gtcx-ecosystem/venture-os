# Session: Baseline Initialization

## What Was Done
- Synchronized `.baseline/` structure with canonical schema
- Verified definition.json presence
- Discovered 1 architectural patterns from codebase
- Discovered 1 active TODOs/FIXMEs in code
- Scanned package.json for ecosystem dependencies
- Generated repo-local BaselineOS runtime config
- Initialized memory files with repo-specific content (not generic templates)

## Files Modified
- baseline.config.json (runtime loader config)
- .baseline/config.json (agent/session metadata)
- .baseline/definition.json (synced)
- .baseline/memory/README.md (updated)
- .baseline/memory/session.md (created)
- .baseline/memory/patterns.md (enriched with discovered patterns)
- .baseline/memory/pitfalls.md (enriched with discovered issues)
- .baseline/memory/dependencies.md (enriched with discovered deps)

## Key Findings
- Tech stack: See patterns.md
- Active issues: See pitfalls.md
- Dependencies: See dependencies.md
- Knowledge paths: ./docs, ./docs, ./.agent, ./.claude, ./.cursor, ./README.md, ./AGENTS.md, ./CHANGELOG.md

## Next Steps
- Run `baseline status` from this repo
- Review discovered patterns for accuracy
- Resolve TODOs/FIXMEs flagged in pitfalls.md
- Verify ecosystem dependencies in dependencies.md
- Re-run `baseline-init` after significant repo changes
