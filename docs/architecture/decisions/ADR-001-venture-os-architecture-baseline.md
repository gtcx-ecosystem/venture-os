# ADR-001: Architecture baseline — venture-os

## Status

Proposed

## Context

**Venture OS** maintains technical truth under `docs/architecture/` per `docs-architecture-pack.json`.

## Decision

- Specs live under `specs/{backend,frontend,data,design,testing}/`
- Architecture decisions are recorded only as `ADR-NNN-*.md` under `decisions/`
- Machine evidence remains in `ops/` and `audit/`; product UX in `docs/product/`

## Consequences

- Fleet IA checks enforce content bar (ADR + spec nests)
- New ADRs supersede this baseline when accepted
