# Pillar scorecard — \`${layer.path}\`

**Read-only rollup** — scores come from published MPR witnesses, not manual entry.

- Policy: [\`../../canon-os/pm/spec/docs-fractal-mpr-policy.json\`](../../canon-os/pm/spec/docs-fractal-mpr-policy.json)
- Pack: [\`${packRel}\`](${packRel}#pillarContract)
- **Layer witness (SoR):** [\`${witnessRel}\`](${witnessRel})

**Composite target:** **${target}/100** per profile at layer audit order.
