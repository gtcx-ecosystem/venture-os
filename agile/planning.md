## Team Configuration

| Role | Count | Names / Handles |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Engineering Lead | [X] | [Name or "Unassigned"] |
| Backend Engineer | [X] | [Name or "Unassigned"] |
| Frontend Engineer | [X] | [Name or "Unassigned"] |
| DevOps / SRE | [X] | [Name or "Unassigned"] |
| QA Engineer | [X] | [Name or "Unassigned"] |
| Product Manager | [X] | [Name or "Unassigned"] |

### Capacity Model

- Sprint duration: [X] weeks ([X] working days)
- Productive hours per day: [X] (accounting for meetings, code review, admin)
- Team capacity: [X] engineers × [X] days × [X] hours = [X] hours
- Target velocity: [X]–[X] story points per sprint
- Point scale: Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)

---

## Definition of Ready (DoR)

A story is ready for sprint commitment when:

- User story follows "As a [persona], I want [action], so that [outcome]" format
- Acceptance criteria are specific, measurable, and testable
- Technical approach has been discussed and agreed by the engineering lead
- Dependencies have been identified and are either resolved or have mitigation plans
- API contracts (request / response schemas) are defined for any new endpoints
- Test data requirements are documented
- Security requirements are identified (authentication, authorization, data handling)
- Story has been estimated by at least two engineers

---

## Definition of Done (DoD)

A story is done when:

- All acceptance criteria are met and verified
- Code has been reviewed and approved by at least one other engineer
- Unit tests written with >[X]% line coverage for new code
- Integration tests passing for all new endpoints
- Linting and type checks pass with zero errors
- API documentation updated (OpenAPI spec or equivalent)
- Database migrations tested (up and rollback)
- Performance meets stated SLA (latency, throughput)
- Security review passed (no secrets in code, proper auth checks)
- Deployed to staging environment and smoke-tested
- Product owner has accepted the implementation

### Sprint is Done When:

- All committed stories meet DoD
- Sprint goal achieved
- Demo conducted for stakeholders
- Retrospective held and action items documented
- Metrics updated (velocity, quality, incidents)
- Next sprint backlog refined
