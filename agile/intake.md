# Intake — venture-os

Repo-local inbound work before P22 selection.

## Sources

| Source | Path | Role |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Human inbox | `pm/_intake/` | Operator-raised items awaiting triage |
| Machine slice | `ops/pm/backlog.json` | Refresh: `pnpm pm:sync` |
| Fleet backlog | [`../agile-os/pm/ecosystem-sprint-backlog.json`](../agile-os/pm/ecosystem-sprint-backlog.json) | Cross-repo programme SoR |
| Bridge handoffs | `docs/operations/coordination/` | Promoted coordination items |

## Intake rules

1. **Classify** — story vs task vs cross-repo (XR) vs blocker witness.
2. **Owner** — every item has an owner repo before sprint commitment.
3. **Promote** — fleet-scope items escalate to agile-os intake; do not duplicate fleet backlog bodies here.
4. **Trace** — link PR/commit/witness when closing.
